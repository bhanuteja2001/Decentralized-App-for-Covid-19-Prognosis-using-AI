# Decentralized App for Covid-19 Prognosis using AI

A horrifying number of people died because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an unexpected threat to food systems, public health, and the workplace. The pandemic has severely disturbed society and there was a serious impediment to the economy. The world went through an unprecedented state of chaos during this period. To avoid anything similar, we can only be cautious. The project aims to develop a web application for the preliminary detection of COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence(AI). This project would enable faster coordination, secured data storage, and normalized statistics. First, the available chest X-ray datasets were collected and classified as Covid, Non-Covid, and Normal. Then they were trained using various state-of-the-art pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with the help of Tensor-flow. Further, they were ranked based on their accuracy. The best-performing models were ensembled into a single model to improve the performance. The model with the highest accuracy was transformed into an application programming interface (API) and integrated with the Decentralized application (D-App). The user needs to upload an image of their chest X-ray, and the D-App then suggests if they should take a reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for confirmation.
